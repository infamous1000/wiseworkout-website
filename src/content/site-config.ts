          "It's the four apps you're already using, in one. Workouts, runs and rides, calories and macros, and the people you train with all sit on the same screen — which means the plan it gives you can account for the whole week instead of one slice of it.",

      {
        question: "I don't have an hour a day.",

          "That's the point. Setup asks how long your sessions realistically run — 30, 45, 60 or 75+ minutes — and how many days a week you can train, anywhere from 2 to 6. It programmes for that, not for an ideal week you don't have. The app's own words: shorter and focused often beats long and inconsistent.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this just ChatGPT with a logo?",
        answer:
          "No, and the difference is what it can see. A chat window starts empty every time — you'd have to retype your last month of sets, your current plan and your injury history before it could say anything useful. WiseCoach already has all three and says so at the top of the thread. It also writes a recap after every session without being asked, which a chat window cannot do at all. There is a language model writing the sentence; what makes the answer worth anything is the training data behind it. And when you want a person instead of a model, Find Professional is one tap away.",

        question: "I already use a running app. Do I have to give it up?",

Beyond it there are two tiers: Free keeps the whole core product — planning, tracking, adaptive support, progress, nutrition, social and coaching — while Premium removes the 25-message monthly cap on WiseCoach chat, unlocks photo and barcode food scanning, and lifts the three-challenge limit. Premium is SGD 29 a month, but payment is not connected yet: in the current build the Upgrade button reads Coming Soon.",
